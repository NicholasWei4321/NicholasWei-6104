# About Me
*Hi! I'm Nicholas Wei. I'm a senior at MIT (Class of 2026) studying 6-3: Computer Science and Engineering. This is my repository for the class 6.104: Software Design.*

Some fun facts about me:
1. I enjoy doing nature photography. Here's my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/catull.us64/?hl=en) where I post some of my photos.
2. I can identify any orchid species in the United States and Canada.
3. I sing in an acapella group at MIT. We're called [Syncopasian](https://www.youtube.com/c/mitsyncopasian) and we sing songs in both English and East Asian languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean!

Below is a photo I took last spring of an orchid species native to Massachusetts, _Neottia bifolia_. Its flowers are only 2-3 millimeters across!
