# Assignment 1

## Domains

### 1. Health/Fitness Tracking
*I go to the gym with my friends, and it would be nice to have a fitness tracker to keep track of how much weight we lift, how much we run, etc.*

### 2. Plant Literature Lookup
*One of my side interests is botany and plant identification. Some plant descriptions are published in very old journals (think 1800s), and they are relatively inaccessible. It would be nice if something could look up plant descriptions for me and my fellow plant enthusiasts.*

### 3. Assignment Tracking
*Different classes post their assignments, syllabi, and rubrics in different places (eg. Canvas, Github, Catsoop). It would be nice if something could keep track of all this information in one place.*

### 4. Dormspam Event Tracking
*Dormspam has a lot of interesting events mixed in with a lot of garbage. It would be nice to have a Dormspam newsletter tailored to someone's preferences.*

### 5. Job Opening Tracker
*Lots of students want to start applying to next year's internships or fulltime roles as soon these roles come out. It would be nice if a tracker tailored to a student's job interests could ping students as soon as those roles open.*

### 6. Random Conversations
*Sometimes people just want to yap about a common interest, but their friends have no interest in those topics. What if an app could find people nearby who have similar niche interests and connect those people?*

### 7. Friendsmaxxing
*Some people want to be more social but have a hard time speaking up or talking to new people. Could we gamify social interaction by creating quests to greet a certain number of people, talk to a certain number of new people, etc.?*

### 8. Debater
*It's really easy to accept what we read online as the truth without considering possible refuting points. Could we create an tool that suggests contradictory or alternative viewpoints to articles that someone reads?*

### 9. Height (Dimension) Estimator
*There's a viral guy on Instagram and TikTok who finds people's "real" heights from videos by finding the exact brand and make of various background objects, calculating the camera warp, and using math to find the person's height. Can we use something similar with image recognition to automate this process?*

### 10. Disgusting Food Eliminator
*Sometimes we see an item of food in shared dorm fridges and it's unclear how long it's been there. Can we create a simple tracker that lets us know how long food has been in the fridge so anyone can toss old items (instead of having to wonder who it belongs to and bugging that person)?*

## Selected Domains (Top 3)

### Domain 1: Friendsmaxxing
I like meeting new people, but it can be very hard to push myself to talk to new people when I have my existing friends to talk to. They're great and fun to talk to, but sometimes I just want to talk to a rando (but I'm shy). Also, in larger conversations, I (and hopefully other people) have a tendency to let other people do the talking. What if we can create a system that pushes us out of our social comfort zone?

#### Problem 1.1: Meeting New People
*Meeting new people can be difficult especially if you have an established group of friends (or even if you don't!). The solution would be an app that gamifies social interactions and provides incentives to meet new people (maybe some cute collectible items, for instance, or a leaderboard).*

I selected this as one of my top 3 problems and will go into more detail below.

#### Problem 1.2: Talking in Large Groups
*If you're an introvert, it can be hard to stake your part in a group conversation because it's much easier to let others do the talking. Then, afterwards, you bang your head against the wall thinking about that really witty thing you could have said but didn't. The solution is pretty similar to problem 1.1 but focuses on talking in large groups.*

I decided not to select this because not everyone necessarily has large groups to talk in, and this might be a later problem that could be tackled after we help people make some friends. I also personally think that this is a harder problem to solve than meeting a new person or just saying something nice to someone.

#### Problem 1.3: Random Compliments
*Have you ever walked past someone who sings really well, is wearing a really fashionable (or weird) piece of clothing, etc., but felt too awkward to pay them a compliment? Let's fix that. Again, this is another problem that could be solved with a gamified social interactions app.*

I actually think this might be able to lumped into the first problem and actually might be socially easier than the first problem, but I feel that the initial core idea was meeting new people, so I want to stick to that.

### Domain 2: Schoolwork Tracking
*Over my past three years at MIT, I've had professors who use a variety of platforms to post announcements, assignments, and grades (eg. Canvas, Github, Catsoop). It would be really nice if there was a tool that integrated all these platforms so that it is easier to keep track of course progress.*

#### Problem 2.1: Integrating Task Deadlines
*A homework tracker that integrates assignments from multiple platforms could help centralize task management for students.*

I selected this as one of my top 3 problems and will discuss it more below.

#### Problem 2.2: Integrating Grades
*Grades, unfortunately, are also distributed across multiple different platforms (primarily Canvas and Catsoop in my experience). It would be nice to centralize grade tracking as well.*

I would either not select this or integrate it into the assignment feature because grades are a little more centralized than assignments so they are already slightly easier to check. This could be an add-on to the assignment feature.

#### Problem 2.3: Assignment Prioritizer
*It would be interesting to have some way to prioritize assignments day-to-day by due date and total percent of overall grade?*

I didn't select this because I think in practice, it's difficult to prioritize assignments because different people finish assignments at different paces, and for procrastinators, who are probably the main target of this feature, their day-to-day priority to-do list might become not useful because it would just be a list of all to-dos. That's very intimidating and not the point of a daily to-do list. 

### Domain 3: Random Conversations
*Talking with your friends is fun, but sometimes they don't give a hoot about of one of your niche interests, and you can tell, despite their gracious efforts to disguise their disinterest. What if we could connect you to people nearby who share the same niche interests that you have?*

#### Problem 3.1: Niche Interest Isolation
*People with specialized hobbies or interests find it hard to find real people nearby who share their passion, which leads them to withdraw into strange online forums instead of interacting with real-life people. The solution would be an app that allows people to find and meet people nearby who share similar interests.*

I selected this as one of my top 3 problems and will discuss it more below.

#### Problem 3.2: Learning New Niche Interests
*What if you just never knew how cool Australian terrestrial members of the Diurideae actually were? Maybe we can introduce users to new niche interests as well.*

I did not select this because I think it's more important to first focus on connecting people with existing interests, and it might be overwhelming to be presented with a wide array of niche interests that users previously didn't know about.

#### Problem 3.3: Conversation Guidance
*Social interactions can be very surface level when people don't know what deeper topics the other person is genuinely interested in discussing. An app could help guide conversations in more interesting directions by listening to conversations and suggesting interesting followups.*

I did not select this because listening in on conversations is invasive and maybe illegal, and having people rely on an app to understand how to ask good followup questions is problematic (they should probably be able to do it themselves). I also think that in practice, this could be hard to implement and could run into a lot of problems that might be hard to solve within the scope of the semester (eg. connectivity issues when listening to conversations, API usage limits for audio/text processing, etc.).

## Selected Problems (Top 3)

### Problem 1: Gamified Meeting New People
*Meeting new people can be difficult especially if you have an established group of friends (or even if you don't!). The solution would be an app that gamifies social interactions and provides incentives to meet new people (maybe some cute collectible items, for instance, or a leaderboard).*

*I think that meeting new people is incredibly satisfying and helps diversify my viewpoints and friend circle. It's a very difficult thing to do in practice in my opinion, but I think that a lot of people want to meet new people and just need some motivation to do so.*

*I think that creating a leaderboard of new people met is an interesting incentive, and/or having a level-up system with rewards unlocked after meeting or interacting with a certain number of people. I also think that we could have subtasks, such as complimenting strangers (which was problem 1.3), or other mini-interaction tasks.*


#### Stakeholders
1. **Friend-searcher (people who want to meet new people)**: *The impact of this app on direct users is that it provides the necessary motivation to push the boundaries of their social comfort zone*
2. **High-contact people (people who don't user the app, but consistently interact with a large volume of people)**: *High-contact people, such as service workers, may be positively impacted in that well-meaning people who may be too shy to interact with them may now be more incentivized to do so.*
3. **Professionals (people who might use data from this app, eg. mental health professionals who might use this app as part of their therapy for anxiety)**: *Mental health professionals might integrate this app into social anxiety treatment plans or use the progress data to track patients' social skill development.*
4. **Institutions (educational instutitions or programs whose students may use this app)**: *Student life departments or orientation programs could use this app to help new students build social connections.*

#### Proposed Features
1. **Social Quest System**: *A daily or weekly challenge system that assigns users specific social interaction tasks with increasing difficulty levels: users earn XP and badges, all of which motivate them to step out of their social comfort zone. They could also accumulate usage streaks.*
2. **Progress Tracking and Social Analytics**: *Visual dashboards showing users their social interaction patterns could help reflect progress over time. It could also be potentially useful data for therapists.*
3. **Fallback/Reassurances**: *It would be important to make sure not to penalize users for not finishing quests, etc. It might also be good to provide useful mental health phone numbers or hotlines.*

### Problem 2: Integrating Task Deadlines
*Over my past three years at MIT, I've had professors who use a variety of platforms to post announcements, assignments, and grades (eg. Canvas, Github, Catsoop). A homework tracker that integrates assignments from multiple platforms could help centralize task management for students.*

*This assignment tracker would provide one single platform and easily collate and display assignment due dates. It could also provide or estimate the time needed for each task and break tasks into subtasks. The key point is that all of these features are done in one place, so that students can easily compare assignments from different classes*

#### Stakeholders
1. **Students (students who want to integrate assignment tasks from various platforms)**: *This task integrator positively impacts students' task management because all to-dos are presented in one place, rather than being scattered across different websites.*
2. **Professors (instructors who unfortunately don't all use one central assignment/grading platofmr)**: *Professors are not directly impacted by this app, but they may feel less pressure to have to use a specific assignment/grading platform, since this app would essential act as an adaptor.*
3. **Teaching Platforms (existing teaching platforms that teachers use)**: *An adaptor between different teaching platforms may reduce the ability of any specific platform to dominate the (hopefully highly profitable) teaching platform product landscape.*

#### Proposed Features
1. **Cross-platform Assignment Sync**: *A system that can automatically connect to Canvas, Github, Catsoop, Schoology, and other LMS platforms to pull together deadlines and descriptions helps students collate assignments rather than having to switch between different platforms.*
2. **Unified Dashboard and Calendar**: *A sleek assignment dashboard and/or calendar displaying all unified assignments helps students with their task management.*
3. **Unified Notification System**: *The app can consolidate due date alerts from all platforms, and it could also break down subtasks and provide rough estimates the time needed for each task.*

### Problem 3: Random Conversations
*Talking with your friends is fun, but sometimes they don't give a hoot about of one of your niche interests, and you can tell, despite their gracious efforts to disguise their disinterest. What if we could connect you to people nearby who share the same niche interests that you have?*

*People with specialized hobbies or interests find it hard to find real people nearby who share their passion, which leads them to withdraw into strange online forums instead of interacting with real-life people. Ok, maybe that's a little extreme, but it would be nice to have an app that allows people to find and meet people nearby who share similar niche interests.*

*This app should take into account distance, so that users focus on finding real-life people near them with whom they can meet in the real world to discuss their interests. It should have a messaging feature that allows users to plan out a real life meeting, but it should also motivate users to then follow through with meetups instead of simply relying on the messaging feature.*

#### Stakeholders
1. **Interesting People (people with niche hobbies who want to find other enthusiasts)**: *Direct users are positively impacted by this app because they are ideally able to find people with similar interests whom they might have otherwise never met*
2. **Online Chat Forums (forums for people with niche interests)**: *These forums may see their users spend more time using this app instead, but the impact may be small, since people will still probably want to make online friends with the same interests.*
3. **Interesting Industries (niche hobby industries, such as card games, collectible toy manufacturers, rare plant nurseries, etc.)**: *These industries may increase in profit if real-world location-based communities assemble or grow larger due to this app.*
